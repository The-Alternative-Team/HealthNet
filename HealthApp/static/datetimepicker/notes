DATETIME QUESTIONS:

In the Team 3 project, Dates and Times are taken separately and stored in the model separately.
They have a date and time picker referenced in base.html
We have the js and css files that they use for date and time picking, all we have to do is reference it in the html
accordingly.
We can do what they do in the forms and take it separately, but then concatenate the two fields into one datetime string
and store it as a datetime in the model like we do already so we don't have to break anything.


PROGRESS:

form validation in modals: two problems in the code, otherwise working and ready to go
datetime picker: files in place, questions for implementation
export information: forms completed
documenting: views documented
test cases: test cases started
